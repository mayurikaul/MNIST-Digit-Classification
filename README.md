# MNIST-Digit-Classification

Deep Discriminant Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a deep neural network built using Keras for classifying handwritten digits, as part of the Assessed Coursework for the Deep Learning module.

Overview

The task is to build and train a deep neural network for classifying the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. 
The trained network will then be evaluated on an unseen test set with handwritten digits, provided separately from the standard MNIST test set.
